Constituency Contact Checklist
==============================

Use this checklist before you contact your MP. Confirming each item ensures their casework team can verify you quickly and take action without requesting extra detail.

1. Confirm the MP
   - Search https://members.parliament.uk/members/commons for your postcode.
   - Note both Westminster and constituency office contact channels.

2. Capture your personal details
   - Full name as it appears on official documents.
   - Residential address including postcode.
   - Best phone number for urgent follow-up.

3. Gather proof of address
   - Recent council tax statement, utility bill, or bank letter (dated within the last 3 months).
   - Scan or photograph in a secure format (PDF/JPEG) ready to share if requested.

4. Outline the issue timeline
   - Bullet each key event with dates.
   - Highlight any deadlines, service standards, or promises already missed.

5. Compile supporting evidence
   - Letters or emails from departments, agencies, or companies involved.
   - Reference numbers and account IDs.
   - Relevant legislation, policy links, or watchdog findings from GOV.UK/Hansard.

6. Record stakeholders and contacts
   - Names and roles of people you have already spoken with.
   - Contact details for escalation points (ombudsman, regulators, council leads).

7. Define your desired outcome
   - State the specific action you need your MP to take.
   - Include any deadlines or events the action relates to.

8. Prepare accessibility or consent notes
   - Accessibility adjustments required for communication (e.g., large print, BSL interpreter).
   - Consent statements if you are writing on behalf of someone else.

9. Draft your message outline
   - Opening confirmation you are a constituent.
   - Summary of the problem and its impact.
   - Evidence points with citations.
   - Clear request and closing thanks.

10. Decide your submission method
    - Constituency email, online form, or postal address.
    - Confirm any attachment limits if using a web form.

11. Plan follow-up steps
    - Calendar reminders for acknowledgement (within 10 working days) and substantive response.
    - Template for a follow-up email if deadlines slip.

12. Log everything in MPWriter
    - Upload documents to the Writing Desk evidence vault.
    - Track correspondence history for future escalations.

Keep this checklist saved with your case file. Updating it after every interaction gives your MP's team the context they need to act quickly.
