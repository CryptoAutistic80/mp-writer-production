            Tell us your issue, answer a few clarifying questions, and we'll research
            the facts and compose a clear, respectful letter to your MP — complete with
            citable sources and a concrete request for action. Most letters are ready within 10–20 minutes,
            with full research, tone customisation, and export options available.

                  Using state‑of‑the‑art AI, we scan reputable sources for supporting
                  facts and figures. We prioritise official publications and trusted
                  outlets — and we include the citations so your MP can verify the evidence quickly.
                  The research process usually takes 10–15 minutes, and can take up to 20 minutes depending on the complexity
                  of your issue. You can track progress in real-time.

                  You can review and edit the draft in the Writing Desk, make multiple revisions,
